# ⚡ Electric Vehicle Data Analysis – Tableau Project

## 📊 Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) data using Tableau. The analysis explores trends in EV adoption across the United States, focusing on key vehicle metrics, manufacturer trends, and state-wise distribution.

The dashboard is created using a `.twbx` Tableau Workbook file and accompanied by a presentation outlining key insights.

## 📁 Project Files

- `Electric Vehicle Data Analysis.twbx`: Tableau workbook containing all visualizations and data models.
- `Electric Vehicle Presentation.pptx`: Presentation deck summarizing key findings and visualizations from the Tableau dashboard.

## 📌 Problem Statement

To understand the growth and adoption of Electric Vehicles in the U.S. and derive actionable insights based on:

- **Total Vehicles**: Analyze the total number of EVs.
- **Average Electric Range**: Assess how far EVs can travel on a single charge.
- **Total BEVs & PHEVs**: Identify the share of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
- **CAFV Eligibility**: Evaluate how many vehicles qualify for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle incentives.
